Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System for CSV Files
Overview
This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying CSV documents. The system encodes the document content into a vector store, which can then be queried to retrieve relevant information.

CSV File Structure and Use Case
The CSV file contains dummy customer data, comprising various attributes like first name, last name, company, etc. This dataset will be utilized for a RAG use case, facilitating the creation of a customer information Q&A system.

Key Components
1. Loading and spliting csv files.

2. Vector store creation using FAISS and HuggingFace embeddings

3. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents

4. Creating a question and answer over the csv data.


Method Details

Document Preprocessing

1. The csv is loaded using langchain Csvloader

2. The data is split into chunks.

Vector Store Creation

1. HuggingFace embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.

2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.

Retriever Setup

1. A retriever is configured to fetch the most relevant chunks for a given query.

Benefits of this Approach

1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.

2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.

3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.

4. Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.


Conclusion
This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval and question-answering systems. By encoding document content into a searchable vector store, it enables efficient retrieval of relevant information in response to queries. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific information within a csv file.
